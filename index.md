## Automating conversion of music files with a Docker container

Code samples for two types of conversions, **FLAC to ALAC** and **FLAC to mp3**, can be found here. If file format you are converting from (or to) is different than what is demonstrated in the code here, feel free to modify the code to get to (and from) format you're interested in.

FYI, I ripped all my audio CDs (I've collected over the years) with Windows Media Player on Windows 10 machine. The output of this long, tedious process (of ripping 200+ CDs) is thousands of songs (neatly organized in folders bearing album names).
