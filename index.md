## Automating conversion of music files with a Docker container

FYI, I ripped all my audio CDs (that I've collected over the years) with Windows Media Player on Windows 10 machine. The output of this long, tedious process (of ripping 200+ CDs) is thousands of high-quality digitial files in FLAC format (neatly organized in folders bearing album names).

Code samples for two types of conversions, **FLAC to ALAC** and **FLAC to mp3**, can be found here. If file format you are converting from (or to) is different than what is demonstrated in the code here, feel free to modify the code to get to (and from) format you're interested in.

I use ALAC specifically on Mac/iPhone and FLAC on MoOde player running on a Raspberry Pi. I also use FLAC files with foobar 2000 / Onkyo HF Player app on Android devices. mp3 files are for those devices/apps that can't play high-quality FLAC / ALAC files.
